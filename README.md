Career Recommendation System
This is a machine learning-based career recommendation system that predicts the best career path for individuals based on their attributes, such as skills, preferences, and more. It leverages Random Forest Classifier for classification and uses data preprocessing techniques like Label Encoding for categorical data.

Overview
This project trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict a user's chosen career path based on various features. It preprocesses the data by encoding categorical variables, splits the data into training and testing sets, and then evaluates the performance using accuracy and classification report.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Scikit-learn: For building the machine learning model and preprocessing

Pandas: For handling and preprocessing the data

NumPy: For numerical operations

RandomForestClassifier: For classification task

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project
