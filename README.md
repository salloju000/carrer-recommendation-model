Career Recommendation System
Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based Career Recommendation System that predicts the best career path for individuals based on their attributes, such as skills, preferences, and more. By using the Random Forest Classifier, the system classifies individuals into different career paths based on their input data.

The system preprocesses the data using Label Encoding for categorical data, applies data splitting (80% train, 20% test), and evaluates the model's performance with metrics like accuracy and a classification report.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Scikit-learn: For building the machine learning model and preprocessing.

Pandas: For handling and preprocessing the data.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

XGBoost: For model enhancement using gradient boosting.

SMOTE: For balancing imbalanced classes in the dataset.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/salloju000/career-recommendation-model.git
cd career-recommendation-model
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Load Data and Train the Model
You can now load your data into a DataFrame. Replace df with your actual dataset.
